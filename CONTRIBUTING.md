## Contribution process

### Code Reviews

All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We
use GitHub pull requests for this purpose. Consult
[GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) for more
information on using pull requests.

### Development and Testing

You can use the following command to compile and install the project:
```shell
mvn clean install -DskipTests
```
The connector's jar file will be located at
`spark-bigtable/spark-bigtable-scala2.12/target/spark-bigtable-scala2.12-0.2.1.jar` and `spark-bigtable/spark-bigtable-scala2.13/target/spark-bigtable-scala2.13-0.2.1.jar`.
(Note the use of `-DskipTests`, as otherwise all tests will be run,
which takes hours. This option still compiles the test JARs.)

To run the unit tests in the `spark-bigtable-core` from `scala 2.12` and `scala 2.13`, you can use this command:
```shell
mvn -pl spark-bigtable/spark-bigtable-scala2.12 test
mvn -pl spark-bigtable/spark-bigtable-scala2.13 test
```

To run the integration tests that are present in the `spark-bigtable-core-it` module, you can use this command:

```shell
#Run integration test with `spark-bigtable-scala2.12`
mvn -pl spark-bigtable-core-it failsafe:integration-test failsafe:verify -DbigtableProjectId=${BIGTABLE_PROJECT_ID} -DbigtableInstanceId=${BIGTABLE_INSTANCE_ID} '-Dconnector.artifact.id=spark-bigtable-scala2.12' '-Dscala.binary.version=2.12' -P integration

#Run integration test with `spark-bigtable-scala2.13` (Default to the latest scala version)
mvn -pl spark-bigtable-core-it failsafe:integration-test failsafe:verify -DbigtableProjectId=${BIGTABLE_PROJECT_ID} -DbigtableInstanceId=${BIGTABLE_INSTANCE_ID} -P integration
```

In the above command, you can replace `-P integration` with `-P long-running`
or `-P fuzz` to run the long-running and fuzz tests, respectively.
(or use `-P integration,long-running,fuzz` to run all
tests). However, note that by design, these tests take hours to run.

### Code formatting
We use [google-java-format](https://github.com/google/google-java-format) to
format Java code. To use this formatter, you can download the JAR and run this
command on a java file that you have udpated:
```shell
java -jar /path/to/google-java-format-${GJF_VERSION?}-all-deps.jar -i /path/to/java/source/code.java
```

We use [Scalafmt](https://scalameta.org/scalafmt/) for Scala code, with the
configurations defined in `.scalafmt.conf`. You can refer to the
[Scalafmt documentation](https://scalameta.org/scalafmt/docs/installation.html)
to enable it in your development environment.
